## Questions/Anwsers
### Question: AsyncTask vs IntentService vs Service?
<b>Anwsers:</b>
<b>Service</b> is a base class of service implementation. Service class is run in the applicationâ€™s main thread which may reduce the application performance.

<b>IntentService</b>, which is a direct subclass of Service is borned to make things easier. The IntentService is used to perform a certain task in the background. Once done, the instance of IntentService terminate itself automatically. Examples for its usage would be to download a certain resources from the Internet.

<b>AsyncTask</b> is designed to be a helper class around Thread and Handler and does not constitute a generic threading framework. AsyncTasks should ideally be used for short operations (a few seconds at the most.) An asynchronous task is defined by a computation that runs on a background thread and whose result is published on the UI thread
