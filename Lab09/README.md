## Questions/Anwsers
### Question: AsyncTask vs IntentService vs Service?
### Anwsers
<b>Service</b> 
- Runs in the applicationâ€™s main thread.
- Performs a longer-running operation.

<b>IntentService</b> 
- Handles a single worker thread, only one request will be processed at a time.
- Stops itself when it runs out of work. 
- Performs a longer-running operation .

<b>AsyncTask</b> 
- Runs on a background thread and whose result is published on the UI thread.
- Used for short operations (a few seconds at the most.)
